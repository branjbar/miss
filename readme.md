MiSS-Project
===============


## Project Introduction
This project addresses the problem of how to derive identities of persons and social structures from large sets of genealogical data available as text and photographs with incomplete information. In order to do so we want to investigate and deploy a combination of techniques from data mining, machine learning and human computation. The project goals are (a) a semantically enriched and cleaned version of the current database of the BHIC; (b) the development of advanced search tools to support historical research; and (c) providing automatic tools for supporting large scale prosopographical research.
